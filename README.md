# NestJs-microservices-with-nats-mysql-docker-
This project is a demonstration of a microservices architecture built with NestJS, using NATS as the message broker, Docker for containerization, MySQL as the database, and TypeORM for object-relational mapping. The system is composed of three main services: an API Gateway, a Users microservice, and a Payments microservice.
